## About
This is an interactive map of Silicon Valley using Google Maps API along with other 3rd-party APIs. It is written with 
JavaScript using KnockoutJS and observables to update the view and JQuery for asynchronous AJAX calls to the 3rd-party APIs. The map is filterable through menus and drawing tools and offers detailed information on each selected company including 
streetview within an infowindow, address, and relevant Wikipedia links and New York Times articles.

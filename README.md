# Interactive Map with Google Maps API

## About
An interactive map of Silicon Valley created with Google Maps API, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and the KnockoutJS framework. This dynamic map is filterable and includes highlighted locations that use observables to update the webpage asynchronously with location-specific information, depending on the selected marker. This information includes an interactive Google StreetView image, company logo and address, as well as relevant New York Times and Wikipedia articles populated using AJAX, JSON, and third-party API requests.

## Opening the Map
1. Save all project files and folders in a single directory.
1. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser.
1. For link functionality within the map, you may need to temporarily disable your browser's pop-up blocker or allow popups from this site as all links open in a separate tab.
